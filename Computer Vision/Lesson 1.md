# Image processing and computer vision - prof. Luigi Di Stefano

* LAB + lesson
* Programming in Python with OpenCV
* Exam for other: couple of questions about the project, couple of questions about the theoretical part
* Exam for AI: you don't have to do a project, you can skip labs. Just an oral exam about the theory. If you want to do a project the oral will be about the project too (50/50); you can even attend the lab and do the curriculum project (3cfu) 

## What is computer vision?

So, **what is the difference between image processing and computer vision?** In the second one, we try to **extrapolate informations from the image**, the knowledge we need to get out of that image. For example, in industrial applications, computer vision could help in recognizing broken bottles.

Image processing is instead concerned with getting images in input, and images in output. Pixels to pixels. ![Screenshot 2020-09-24 at 11.57.31](/Users/simone/UniBO/unibo-ai/Computer Vision/res/imageprocessing-vs-cv.png)
