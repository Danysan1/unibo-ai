# Digitization and camera sensors

## Digitization in practice

The sensor is a 2d array of photodetectors, which convert incident light into a **proportional electric charge**. Then, in the case that the output has to be digital, the ADC circuitry converts digitizes the signals.

Today, the two main sensor technologies are **CCD** and **CMOS**.

## Camera parameters

So, what should we look at when buying a camera? We'll now provide an intuitive explanation, while formal definitions and measurements can be found in the *EMVA Standard 1288*.

### Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)

This is a very important parameter: noise has a large impact in image processing and computer vision. Basically, noise is generated by: 

- *Photon Shot Noise*, the number of photons collected is not stable. The light captured by the camera is not deterministic, but it is a random variable governed by a Poisson statistic;
- *Electronic Circuitry Noise*, generated by the electronics which read out the charge and amplify the signal;
- *Quantization Noise*, related to the ADC;
- *Dark Current Noise*, charge due to thermal excitement observed at each pixel even in the dark. Therefore, it happens even when the shutter is closed! This one is common in solid state sensors. This phenomenon is highly related to **temperature**: the *hotter*, the *more noise*.

Given this, measurements of the same pixel are gonna change even if the image is static. Therefore, the measurement at iteration $i$ will be $I_i (p) = I_i^* (p) + n(p)$, where $I_i^*$ is the real signal while $n(p)$ is the noise.

Now, given this model, the only thing we can do is taking more measurements and averaging them: when we do so, the $n(p)$ tends to delete itself (let's say positive and negative noises alternate in a approximately standard distribution). **We assume noise to be IID, and have zero average:** $N(0, \sigma^2)$.

So, the question becomes: I have my image, how can I take more measurements in a little time? The solution might be averaging neighbouring pixels!
