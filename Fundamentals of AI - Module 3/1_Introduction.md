# Introduction

This module is about uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning. We cannot observe everything in the world, something will be hidden, non determinable, etc.
We need to be able to model this uncertainty.
When we make decisions we must keep a belief state and generate a contingency plan.
This module is composed by 10 hours of lecture in 5 lectures.

## Topics
- Basic probability notation: Probabilistic notations already studied in Statistical and Matematical Methods, Logical connectives
- Inference using full joint distributions: Take decisions basing on the modeled world
- Independence: Construct complex models of the world in an abstract way (more compact than probabilistic notation)
- Bayesian network representation: Another way of mdeling the world
- Constructing Bayesian networks
- Exact and approximate inference: Thought process based on baesyan networks 
- Simple case studies

## Material
- Slides on Virtuale
- The same of FAIKR mod 1 (Russel, Norvig, "Artificial Intelligence. A modern Approach"), chapters 13 & 14
- ipython notebooks on Virtuale

## Exam
Grades on an 8-point scale (to be summed with mod 2 and 4 and averaged with mod 1). Grades don't expire.

Two alterantives:
- Written exam
  - Questions and exercises, 4 dates a year (jun, jul, sep, jan)
  - If you don't like your grade you can repeat it
- Project
  - Implementation of simple case study in pgmpy or other library
  - ipython notebook + good notebook comments or pdf report
  - Oral exam to present work done and answer questions (3 discussion periods in jun+jul, sep and jan+feb)
  - Can be done alone or in groups u to 3 people
  - You should give the project exam when you are ready to make it one-shot, you shouldn't get in a situation where you don't like your grade
