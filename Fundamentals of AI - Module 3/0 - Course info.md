# Fundamentals of AI - module 3

This shall be a small introduction to the course. It'll be a very *condensed* module. 

## Why this?

We have already seen a notion of *logical agents*, which reason thanks to a *perfect knowledge* of the world. We have already solved problems like plannig, but not something like:

*We're guests on a TV show, we stand in front of 3 closed doors... [Monty Hall problem]*

We therefore have to handle uncertainty: it may be due to **partial observability**, **non-determinism**, or even both. How can we address these problems? We may perform a *contingency plan*, considering every possibility. This may be pretty large, and there may be no plan that's guaranteed to reach the goal. 

## Topics

We'll discover some topics: we'll start with some basic probability notation (some of them have already been covered by Piccolomini), inference using full joint distributions, independence (allowing us to reach conclusions efficiently)...

## Material

* Slides (available on Virtuale)
* Textbook: the evergreen *Russel Norvig*
* Additional textbooks:
  * Probabilistic Graphical Models, Koller Friedman
  * Foundations of probabilistic logic programming, Riguzzi
* Software:
  * PGM Python: `pgmpy`

## Exam

We can choose between project or thoretical exam. 

### Exam

Questions and/or exercise, 4 dates per year.

### Project

Implementation of a simple case study in `pgmpy` or something else, ipython book+PDF report. Then, oral exam to present work and answer questions. 3 discussion periods per year. 

We have to present the work, and answer questions about the project, covering the course topics but mainly covering the project.

The projects are individual but pair/3 person programming is accepted. The grades are given on a 8-point scale. 

The discussion periods are:

* June/July, from the end of lectures until the summerbreak;
* September, from the end of summerbreak until the start of lectures;
* Next year, after the christmas break until the lectures start again.

The module is going to last 10 hours, 5 lectures.
