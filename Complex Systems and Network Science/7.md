# 7. Network Science: Introduction

Network science is the study of complex systems by exploring the structure and dynamic evolution of the underlying networks. It can be applied to gain insight into modern society, economy, biology, technology and many basic sciences.

A **network** is an abstract mathematical construct representing the relations that exist between pairs of objects.
 - Networks can represent any binary relationship over objects
 - Both objects and relationships can be physical or virtual
 - Common to visualize networks graphically
 - A network is defined by the list of objects and the relations that exist over objects, not by its visualization
 - The same network can have many different visualizations
