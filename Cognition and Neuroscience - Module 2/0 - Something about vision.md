These first two lessons will talk about selective visual attention, seeing what it is, something about vision, then something about attention. 

So, we'll talk about selective attention in **vision**. There may be chats about this topics for other senses, but vision is the dominant sense for us and it is therefore interesting. 

A large part of our brain is dedicated to vision, more than half. What are we talking about? There are many informations reaching our eyes, many stimula, and we cannot process them all at the same way: our processing capacity is extremely limited, and activating neurons is quite expensive in terms of energy. We need to focus on a small subset of stimulae. How are we able to do so, and how do we choose what to focus on?

Only some stimula are available at each instant, and those are the ones influencing our behaviour. The others, stay unprocessed. We therefore select a certain number of inputs, and this is the definition of the thing. Describing the tendency to select a subset of stimula.

Just to give us an idea, there are many examples. A first example is **change blindness**, a scene made by two images, separated by a blank. The second image is slightly different, having a local detail which is different. 

## Something about vision

Vision is an enormous chapter in neuroscience. It is used for two reasons, object recognition and guidance of our actions. Primary visual cortex (or striate, because of ) V1 is the first area of processing. From V1 the input is broadcasted across two pathways: the **dorsal** (top of the brain, towards the parietal lobe) and the **ventral** (towards the temporal lobe).

What's important is understanding the concept of **visual field**: if you put your hands on the sides of your eyes, what you see is the visual field. The line in the middle separates the left and right hemifields. The two parts are actually separately processed by the two parts of the brain. Just to remember, the right side is processed in the left hemisphere, while the left side is processed in the right hemisphere. When someone has a lesion in one hemisphere, they stop seeing the hemifield. Only if you have damage in the brain you are able to see one single hemifield. Closing an eye doesn't change things. 

The functional unit of the vision system is the **receptive field**. We are talking about receptive field of a **single neuron**. We'll look at neurons one at a time. Receptive fields might have different size. What is the definition of it? They are **small regions of the stimulus space (e.g. vision field)** for which, when you have a stimula in the receptive field, they trigger the neuron. The receptive field is not about vision only: sounds have a receptive field too (for example, think about frequencies), touch, smell...

The term RF refers to the region of visual space where changes in luminance influence the activity of a single neuron. 

The tip of an electrode can be put inside a hole in your head to go into the cortex (*just the tip, bro*) can record action potential to study RF properties of visual neurons, both in animals and humans. 

Visual neurons respond to stimuli only in a limited region of space. 

How the retina is then mapped depends on **retinotonic maps**. At the very beginning, the stimula mapping is maintained: two points that are close in the visual field will be also close in the LGN and the V1. There is a somewhat preservation of the mapping, which is then encoded in retina coordinates which are referred to the centre of the retina. There is some isomorphism between the vision field and its representation in the brain. 

Although the map is isomorphic, it is extremely distorted then. There are certain regions that are more represented than other regions: there is a *magnified* representation of the center (the FOVEA) and a slight precise representation of its surroundings. This is why we are gazing at things and moving our eyes: the periferic areas receive less focus, and we also fail to see the color in these areas. We are predicting the color of things, but we're actually color-blind in those areas.

There are many maps: at the very beginning they're all retino-topic, but then they lose their isomorphicity. The representation is putting emphasis on some areas.

Close to the FOVEA the receptive field is very small, while it gets larger when far from the FOVEA.

The receptive field of a retinal cell is the same as one of a LGNC. The first and second stage have therefore similar functional properties: the RF is small, **circular** (which will become lines in V1) with two antagonistic regions, a center and a surround.

It is a center-surround construction. Paradoxically, if you threw a large light to the whole receptive field, the excitatory and inhibitory parts would delete themselves and you wouldn't get an activation. A small light in the exact center will surely activate the thing, but if you put a light in the surround it will inhibit. So the cell is responding to on-light in the center, and off-light in the surround: this is perfect to encode movement. 

If the light is outside of the field, you get nothing, if it covers the whole field, you get nothing.

In complex cells, ON and OFF regions are superimposed, i..e that every location responds both to black and white bars. We need these type of cells to recognize things like a dark bar. This is the first example of positional invariance in the visual processing, but it requires **one specific direction of movement**, which should be perpendicular to the preferred direction. 

Selective visual attention is generated by our limited processing capacity and our selectivity. The bad news is we have limited capacity, but the good news is that we're able to select, i.e. give resources to what it needs them. 

There are two ways in which attention can bias competition towards relevant informations. Neural resources compete. Competition can be influenced by automatic attention (you don't control it).
