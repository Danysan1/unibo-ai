# RL and Pavlovian learning

The rules of RL are based on the two learning paradigms: Pavlovian learning (learning process with a reinforcer associated with a neutral stimulus). For something to be a reinforcer, it should arouse the subject, for example food, sex, water. Salivation or the pupil dilation is a good sign of arousal. 

The association has to be surprising at first: the associability (learning rate) is crucial. Initially, the expected reward is zero, but then we improve our predictions, which slowly get more and more similar to what we get.

## Dopamine

There's evidence that in the brain, some neurons use a signal which is very similar to the reward prediction error. There are two main pathways: one starting from the substantia nigra (black), one from the ventral tegmental area.

If you present the conditional stimulus, always after the same interval, the firing is always the same and everything gets predicted. Usually the inter-trial is something you vary, in order to ask the animal to pay attention! If it is predictable, you don't get responses anymore. If you train the animal with the exact same amount of signals (one drop/half drop/two drops and so on...), it won't learn. If everything is as predicted, no learning happens.
