## What you'll find here
- Some LaTeX notes I wrote in the beginning, which were abandoned fast;
- [A summary](https://github.com/montali/unibo-ai/blob/master/Statistical%20and%20Mathematical%20Methods%20for%20AI/Review-notes.md) containing pretty much everything you may need for the exam;
- An [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) package to review before the exam.

## Useful resources

- [This series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) is incredibly useful and clarifies lots of concepts. Highly recommended.
