# Combinatorial Decision Making and optimization

Module I (april 22 - june 4) will follow module II (feb 18 - apr 15).

## Prerequisites

Basic staff, problem solving, logic, basic notions of programming (python), basic algebra. 

## What is this course about?

We'll learn some popular methods that model and solve complex combinatorial optimization problems, such as onstraint programming, integer linear programming, SAT, SMT.

## What is combinatorial decision making about?

Decision making within many combinations, subject to restrictions. We may have to satisfy contraints and get any solution, or to get the best one.

For example, a use case might be the assignment of infected people to hospitals, basing on some constraints like severity, age, location... Here, an approach using neural networks is not suitable: often we don't have enough historical data, but even if we had, the process would be quite time-consuming. 

Optimization is basically the last phase of data analytics (prescriptive analytics) -> taking the best course of action given some data. We have data, how can we take the best action? 

Combinatorial decision making isn't easy. It's computationally difficult (NP-hard): we don't have algorithms, we'll need intelligent search, like heuristic search methods, Integer Linear Programming (ILP, module 2), Constraint Programming (CP, module 1), Boolean Satisfiability (SAT, module 1),  Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT, module 1).

## Course info

Theoretical foundations and practical exercises (bring a laptop!).

### Lecture material

* Slides, on Virtuale (password 130169);

* A list of readings, available on the course website;
* Discussion board on Virtuale.

### Tools

Module 1 will need **MiniZinc** and **Z3**, while module 2 will need **Python**.

## Assessment

No written exam. We'll do two projects (one per module). It is possible to have groups of 2 people.
