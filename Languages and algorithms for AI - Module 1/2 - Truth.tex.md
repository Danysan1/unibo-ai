# Truth

First of all, we re-define **truth**: basically being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard. Truth is usually associated to the sensible world: you observe an experiment, if it is repeatable than you have *truth*. For example, you throw a ball to the ground, it is true that it falls because it always will.

In mathematics, we have truth in, for example, *The sum of the internal angles of a triangle is $180$Â°*, but this becomes false in spherical geometry! The consequences are that the **axiomatic method is not a description of the sensible world**. The conclusion is that we **should replace the notion of pure truth** by the notion of **logical consequence**. The important one is the latter, which is based on the notion of truth. 

In mathematics, we can state that **a statement is true in a specific world, described by a specific axiom**. Rather than focusing on the **absolute** notion of truth, we focuse on a **relative** notion of truth, being relative on a set of axioms, i.e. a model where these axioms are true. Then, rather than talking about general truth, we are interested in the truth with respect to those axioms.

Now, let $\Gamma = F_1, \dots, F_n$ we say that $F$ is a logical consequence of $\Gamma$, written as $\Gamma|=F$, if it is always true that for each world in which all the formulas in $\Gamma$ are true, also $F$ is true. In other terms, whenever all the sentences in $\Gamma$ are true, $F$ is true too. We're not interested in knowing whether $F$ is always true, just in its world. 

Therefore, **truth is always defined with respect to a world** and a **given intepretation of symbols** in that world. We are not interested in the truth of a single sentence, but in the truth with respect to a set of other sentences, i.e. a **logical consequence**.
