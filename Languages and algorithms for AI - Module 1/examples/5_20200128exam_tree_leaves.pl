% A binary tree is either empty or it is composed of a root element and two successors,
% which are binary trees themselves. In Prolog we represent the empty tree by the atom nil and the
% non-empty tree by the term t(X,L,R) where X denotes the root node and L and R denote the left
% and right subtree, respectively. A leaf is a node with no successors. For example, the tree in the
% Figure is represented by the term t(a,t(b,nil,nil),t(c,nil,nil)) and b and c are leaves.
%
% (Figure 1: a tree with only a root and two leaves)
%
% Write a Prolog program which def1nes a predicate count leaves/2 to count the leaves of a tree:
%
% count_leaves(T,N) :- the binary tree T has N leaves.
