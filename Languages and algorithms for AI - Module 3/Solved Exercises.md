# Problem Examples from virtuale 20/21 - WIP

## Problem 1

Construct a deterministic TM of the kind you prefer, which decides the following language:

![L=\{w\in\{0,1\}^*\mid&space;w&space;$&space;does&space;not&space;contain&space;01&space;as&space;a&space;substring$\}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?L%3D%5C%7Bw%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E*%5Cmid%20w%20%24%20does%20not%20contain%2001%20as%20a%20substring%24%5C%7D)

Study the complexity of TM you have defined.

### Solution

The alphabet Γ can be defined as {▷,□, 0, 1}, while the set of states Q is
{qinit, qs, qr}. The transition function is specified as follows:


## Problem 2

You are required to prove that the following function _**f**_ is in **FP**. To do that, you can give a TMs or define some pseudocode.
The function is one that, given a list _L=L1,…,Ln_, returns its inverse, namely _Ln,Ln−1,…,L1_.

### Solution

## Problem 3

We studied the problem **CLIQUE**.
You are required to classify the subset **THREECLIQUE** of **CLIQUE** consisting of all the pairs **(_G_,3)**.
To which class does **THREECLIQUE** belong? 

### Solution
