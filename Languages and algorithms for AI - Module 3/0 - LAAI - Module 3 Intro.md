# LAAI - Module 3

AI and ML are everywhere. Every problem could possibly be solved by AI! We may want to find the algorithms that solve a problem in a **better way**, i.e. efficiently and with good accuracy. If we know that a task is intrinsically hard, we could direct towards methodologies which are made for that, avoid spending our time on stupid solutions, inform the stakeholders...

Suppose we wanted to write a python program multiplying two integers, without using the python multiplication operator: our numbers will be considered as *lists of digits*, having length `n`, each element of which is a char between 0 and 9. There's multiple methods for solving this.
