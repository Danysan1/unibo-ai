# Defending from cyber attacks

## External cybersecurity consultants

The first fundamental step to defend correctly an organization is to study the organization itself to understand its:
* Sector: Dimension, market, products, services
* Vision and commitment of top management
* Structure (formal and informal), internal and external business processes
* maturity level of digitalization and cybersecurity
* On-premise/outsourcing/hybrid orientation, suppliers
* ...

Then a good cybersecurity consultant should propose customized changes FIRST at the governance level and ONLY THEN at the technological level, considering the design, implementation and 24/7 management of the chosen solution.

Lots of (bad) cyber security vendors and consultants try to sell whatever they have in stock, often technology-only solutions (""magic boxes""), without tailoring it to the target organization. This is because cybersecurity is currently an asymmetric market (most customers don't know anything about cybersecurity) and because a good cybersecurity requires a (possibly costly) reorganization with an effort without end date and apparently doesn't immediately lead to an increase in value, so it's hard to sell a good cybersecurity solution.

Part of the the solution to sell good cybersecurity to skeptical organizations is not to hinge on fear but to sell it as a feature that can increase the value of products (""embedded security"").
Regulations on cybersecurity and data protection are becoming one of the main motivators for security investments, but a company can be compliant without proper security in place, it's important to convince management to really reach security. Also, a lot of norms are focused on technology, although recently some norms are improving their focus on business.
Still, this alone might not be enough to convince them, but on the long term people, organizations and regulators can realize the importance of security and reliability for their safety and bottom line.

Understanding who is hiring the cybersecurity service is fundamental:
* project managers need support on short-term projects
* functional / middle level managers need support on medium term on parts of the organization
* top managers need support on long term strategic decisions and restructuring of the whole organization

## Internal cybersecurity department

Cybersecurity used to be part of the IT department, but this is not sufficient because it considers security only as a technological problem and because the controller (cybersecurity) and controlled (IT) cannot be in the same department. Today companies with a good security strategy have distinct departments: IT (led by the CIO) and Cybersecurity (led by the CISO).

A good CISO should not create obstacles to business by following blindly a cybersecurity ""religion"": he must know well its organization's business lines and processes to protect and empower them.

## Maturity level models

To this day it's still hard to estimate the Return On Investment of cybersecurity. Around 2009 it was studied a "Return On Security Investment" but it didn't work. Without a good ROI model for cyber-security we need a qualitative evaluation of cyber-security maturity level.

Old maturity level evaluation models focused only on technologies. This is not enough.
Modern models include people, process and technology ("PPT vision").
An example is the NIST model, which contains 5 level, each with the 3 parts.

Once maturity levels are evaluated, a realistic improvement project can't jump directly many levels. It's important to plan the rise level by level, so that visible results and feedbacks are frequent and verifiable. Reaching the next level becomes more costly at each level.

## Cyber-security approaches

- Reactive: only reacts to attacks, set up for failure
- Compliance-driven: aligned to standards
- Risk-based: proactive
- Cybersecurity by design
