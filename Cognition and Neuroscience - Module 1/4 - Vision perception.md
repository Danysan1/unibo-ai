# 4 - Vision perception

How does the vision system percept immediate input? There's lots of information, and we'd like to extract a generalization. The fact that eyes have different positions influences the visual field: if you close your left eye you lose some of the sight. The representation overlaps, but not fully!

There's lag between the perception of a *moving object* by the two eyes. The representation of the object in the two eyes is changing. The model will lose specificity to achieve the perception of the movement: moving objects are more difficult to observe for us. This characteristic can allow us to start thinking at lower levels. If we move forward than this, and we pick movement as a feature we want to observe, among edges, motion, binocular disparity, color, these can be considered as low-level properties, the combination of which allow us to perform feature detection. 

The information that in front of us is a young lady is achieved further on. One of the reason this is is that we are able to spot little details. This is an important element to take into consideration. What is the role of early sensory areas like V1 in this?

There are areas which are coding for more abstract information. There's no simple explanation for these results. It's just one important aspect that needs further information. 

An influential way of understanding information processing in V1 is viewing these neurons as feature detectors: we already have sensations in response of the retina, and at the level V1 we have no perception of faces, for example, but all the elements that determine it: color, shape, motion, edges...

It's crucial to think that the system is heavily organized, we're no longer talking about anatomy. This is not a characteristic of the visual system alone: other areas are built like this.

When we record EG activity in the brain, what we see is alpha activity, which might serve this thalamo-cortico-thalamic inhibitory connections.

Continuous EEG recordings are online ot the TMS, and we're interested in knowing whether anything before the TMS pulse influenced the ability of the patient to succeed.

*So, do spontaneous fluctuations in posterior alpha-band EEG activity reflect variability in excitabiliy of human visual areas?*

The amplitutde of alpha is very important: if there's a reduction, we'll have a clear predisposition to excitability in the visual cortex, i.e. more likely to perceive information. If there's less, there's a sort of inhibition, we're less likely to perceive incoming information. The result is the subject might well use alpha activity information as a gate towards perceived informations, i.e. opening/closing a gate for incoming informations to regulate the quantity of perceived infos.
