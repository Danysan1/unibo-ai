# Plasticity in the brain

The idea is that our **neurons** don't just communicate, rather send/receive informations in a way that aids the system to sustain itself. 

One of these ways, known as **hebbian plasticity**, leading to the fact that we'll have a strenghtening of more used connections: connections undergo structural changes, which make the network stronger, i.e. more capable of doing something.

For example, when learning a new musical instrument, the more practice we get, the better we are.

Hebbian plasticity is crucial from the AI point of view: having to produce a system that is capable of having this *plasticity* requires understanding how the system works. 

## Key concepts

We now need to track down what is of interest:

- How visual motion areas are connected (we know that movement triggers different motion areas, the more complex the movement, the more areas)
- How changing the weight of a connection modulates the perception of motion

Finally, the greatest question: we know that if we keep on doing something, we get better. Then, **why does this happen and how?**

What we're interested in is understanding, if we continuously do something, how a non-changing experiment is performed better by the network. We can do this artificially, but since we want to control what is going on (i.e. isolating one component of a pretty complex network), we're looking for some causal evidence.

We're looking at how the feedback connectivity affects sensitivity to motion. This is made by a neuro-stimulation paradigm using TMS with two coils that are targeting the two areas we're interested in, which are repeatedly stimulated to try and moderate the performance of the subjects in the global motion perception task. Note that TMS coils are covering huge areas of the brain, but it's quite likely that by stimulating an area we're covering the right neurons, which are functionally connected. So if you think that v1 is the area we're interested in, and v5 is the area for motion perception, we'll want to strengthen the connection between these two by stimulating the areas.

Researches have shown that the connection between V5 and V1 has a 20ms lag in real situations, so we can perform stimulations intervalled by 20ms to try and reinforce the connection V5-->V1.
