# C&N M1 Summary

## Nervous System

- Central Nervous System
  - Spinal cord
  - Brainstem
  - Cerebellum
  - Cerebrum
    - Lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal
    - Hemispheres: left, right
- Peripheral Nervous System
  - Sensory cells

## Neuron

Structure:
- Dendrites
  - Synapses
- Soma
- Axon
  - Axon terminals

### Types
- Bipolar (one axon and, dendritic tree)
- Unipolar (one stem)
- Multipolar (one axon, many dendritic trees)

### Chemical components
- Intracellular and extracellular fluid 
  - Cations (Sodium Na+, Potassium K+) and Anions (Chloride Cl-, Organic anions A-)
- Cell membrane
  - Ion channels
  - Ion pumps (*sodium-potassium pumps*)

### Chemical behavior:
- Ions create a membrane potential (voltage difference)
- When a channel is opened molecules tend balance and lower the potential thanks to *Diffusion* and *Electrostatic* pressure
- When a pump is activated it exchanges ions creating the *Membrane resting potential* of -70mV
- A message travelling along an axon takes the form of a sudden change in the membrane potential, the *Action Potential* (AP), if the stimulus is at or above a certain threshold, the action potential is triggered, and the membrane potential is suddenly reversed to +40mV, then it returns to -70mV
- Most axons are covered in a myelin sheath which propagates the faster
- Nodes of Ranvier regenerate the signal along the axis
- The rate of firing (which cannot exceed 1kHz) is directly correlated to the intensity of the stimulus

### Communication between neurons

1. **Pre-synaptic** (terminal buttons of the first neuron) release neurotransmitters (NTs) when receiving the AP
2. NTs traverse the **synaptic gap**
3. **Post-synaptic membrane**'s NT receptors (in the second neuron dendrite) make ion channels open and let ions enter and leave generating an Excitatory Post-Synaptic Potential (EPSP, depolarizes) or Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Potential (IPSP, hyperpolarizes).
