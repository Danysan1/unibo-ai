# Conscious perception

What we perceive is not always what is actually there: it's an internal signal. An important measure of perception is **confidence**: our choice has a certain confidence for us. Our system is continuously building up models to somehow predict what will happen next, and it always compares the external outcome with the internal prediction.

We have talked about the fluctuation in alpha oscillasions, that might map in the visual performance: if our alpha is high, should we need less energy to perceive things?

Lower alpha power prioir to simulus onset, is associated with higher chance of visual detection: we have a lower visual detection threshold. The inverse is true too. When our alpha power is high (since it acts as inhibitory action), we are inhibiting information that is coming in. 

It's very important to consider that there has been an important research about this particular phenomenon: it seems like the brain is computing on a trial by trial basis the capacity to perceive more or less the environment. Literature has re-itnerpreted these kind of datasets, to allow more interpretations: we are essentially building up internal models of the environment!

Can we find a different interpretation on this alpha phenomenon?

An experiment tried to prestimulate alpha oscillations with a *fixation cross*, and some people improved. What the scientists tried to find out was whether the patients that were able to complete the task had any difference from the others. The results showed that the participants that were able to spot the stimuli had a certain modulation depending on the task prior to the presentation of the stimuli. What is interesting is what happens before the presentation of the stimulus: our brain is trying to model the environment and predict it. We have two types of people: those good at the task and those who aren't. The difference between them is found in the overall amplitude of alpha: if you are very bad at the task, your capacity to synchronize alpha before the stimulus is bad. Those that were good at desynchronozing the alpha activity, i.e. get the visual cortex more excitable and enhance the capacity to correctly look at stimula. 

## MEG and EEG

We have giant MEG devices, but portable ones exist too! These new type of sensors can be mounted directly on the scalp, and the patient can therefore move in the space. MEG devices are very expensive but much more precise than EEG ones. 

One might ask: is the alpha power related with our internal representation, or with our perception? High alpha power matches with low probability of spotting the signal. And we know that. 

The value $d'$ can help us understand what our responde is: when $d'$ is 1, we have lots of overlap between the signal and the niose, so we'll have lots of false alarms. But if the signal is stronger and there's less overlapping with the noise ($d'=3$), we'll behave better. The higher $d'$, the better we are at picking up the signal. Now the question is, seeing the previous examples, they were missing an important aspect: they were not considering the criterion, i.e. not considering the accuracy. They were considering the hits, not their relationships with the false alarms. 

What is important is seeing what **was missing in previous experiments**: the calculation of the $d'$ and the criterion! $d'$ is the **discriminability index**, i.e. the discriminability of a signal, depending on the spread of the noise-alone and the signal-plus-noise curves. $d'=\frac{separation}{spread}$.

This number is an estimate of the strength of the signal, it's a true measure of the internal response: what we can do is that we can account for these different possibilities, having values of $d'$ that will discount the false alarms.
