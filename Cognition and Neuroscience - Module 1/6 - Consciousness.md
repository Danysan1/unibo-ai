# Consciousness

How can we define **consciousness**? Something like *the subjective experience of being conscious*. 

Why should we need this? An AI isn't conscious and works better than us! One thing  to denote is that if you try to get what we need it for, we may think about an evolutionary thing that changes behaviour. If the environment wants us to adapt, and the information aid us in building a model, why does the conscience take form?

The *theatre hypothesis* states that conscious events happen in the *theatre of consciousness*.

The consciousness acts as a bright spot on the stage, and it is surrounded by a fringe of events that are only vaguely conscious. The rest of our brain is doing things in background/receiving informations from the bright spot. Now, why this theory? What sense does it make? Why is it heavily grounded in psychology? We; ll talk about the backstage as the neural processes, the bright spot as our **attention**, and the rest of the stage as the **working memory**.
