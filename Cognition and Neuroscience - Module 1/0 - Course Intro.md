# Cognitive neuroscience

We started talking about this discipline around 1976 by psychologists (Gazzaniga/Miller). Gazzaniga was one of those people that really made a point about the relationship, studying **split brain patients** (patients in which the left and right brain are artificially separated, so there's no interaction between the two parts). This treatment actually stopped the spread of epilectic seizures, and apparently the person started to be quite normal, until they noticed that the person started to behave as **two different people**!

What do we mean by **cognitive neuroscience**? It's an integration of multiple disciplines, mixing psychology, neuroscience, cognition, social cognition, emotional processing, computer models, which studies the neural processes underlying cognition.

We have **neuroscience** on one hand (known and discussed for many years, _wet neuroscience_) and **cognitive science** on the other. Putting these two (science of the neuron vs science of cognition) led to this science, trying to understand the relation between the structure of the brain and its function.

We are basically studying the relation between the system (body) and its functions (the behaviour).

So, _how did we get there?_ Or _how does the brain create the mind?_ This is known as the **mind-body problem**. Philosophers have always been interested in this question.

The first link of the mind to the brain was by Galenus (129-210 AC). He still thought that personality and emotions were generated by organs other than the brain. The crucial point, though, was that the mind and body were connected.

### A little bit of history

- The first to claim that the mind was localized in the brain was Galenus (129-210 AC) but thought that personality and emotion were generated by other organs.
- Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) did believe that the brain and the nervous system are the centre of the mind and emotion.
- Rene' Descartes (1596-1650, also known as Cartesio) believed in the sharp distinction between the physical and the mental. He recognized that the brain has a key role for sensory input and motor output, but this did not make it the basis of mind. He was wrong about the _pineal gland_, but he wasn't that wrong in thinking that conscious experience was located in the fusiform region of the brain. In fact, Descartes also made a distinction between what would now be called “bottom-up” (from the body) and “top-down” (from the soul) processes. The passions such as joy and anger agitate and disturb the mind. There is, therefore, a clear distinction between the phisycal and the mental: the _res extensa_ (physical) and the _res cogita_ (inconsistent thinking materia).
- Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) proposed that the mind and the body are separated substances but constructed from the outset to run together in perfect harmony.
- **Offray de la Mettrie** (1709-1751) **believed that matter (the phisical components) is fundamental and is the cause of mental events.** Voluntary (cognitive) processes result simply from more complex mechanisms than involuntary and instinctive processes. This is in essence the believe held by many of us who are currently working in the field of cognitive neuroscience
- Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) divided the brain into sections that corresponded to certain behaviors and traits that he called fundamental
  faculties. This is referred to as localization of function. Gall developed the theory of Organology and the method of Cranioscopy that would later be known as Phrenology. Phrenology was later disproved by Pierre Flourens (1794-1867). The idea was great, the way of doing this research was kinda questionable: he looked for **shapes** in the head, like bumps, etc...
  Phrenology is nowadays seen as a _pseudo-science_, but his studies helped establish psychology as a science!
- John H Jackson(1835-1911) produced the first scientific demonstration of localization of function. He started to try and localise the areas of the brain which control different functions, like muscles.
- **Gustav Fechner** (1801-1887) was a key figure in the development of psychophysics (what we still use today). He believed that mind and body were two aspects of a single entity and that mental processes could be measured. **Fechner succeeded in showing that the mental could be measured and was closely linked to the physical.**
- William James (1842-1910) pointed out that mental processes can be abolished by brain injuries or altered by drugs, therefore Physiology is needed to understand Psychology. Introduced “psychophysics” as the study of the relation between physical stimuli and reportable sensations.
- Emil du Bois-Reymond (1848) demonstrated the electrical basis of nerve impulse
- **Santiago Ramon y Cajal** (c.1890) **theorized the neuron, a discrete cell which is the primary computation unit of the nervous system.**
- **The first serious attempts to localize mental functions to specific locations in the brain was by Paul Broca** (1824-1880) **and Carl Wernicke** (1848-1905) by studying the effects of injuries to different parts of the brain on psychological functions.

## Important guys in neuroscience

### Gustav Fechner

### Frans Donders

First theorized reaction times, representing the time that the mental process requires. He actually distinguished between the simple reaction time (press a button when you hear the beep), vs. choice reaction time (left or right?).

The subtraction between these two later became the standard procedure in functional brain imaging.

### William James

[Cool article here](https://markmanson.net/the-prime-belief). The father of modern psychology. Understood that physiology was needed to understand psychology, and pointed out than mental processes can be altered by injuries, drugs, etc...

### Hermann von Helmholtz

Started studying psychology in parallel with the nervous system. He developed the _myograph_, measuring the speed of travel of nerve impulses, discovering the concept of _velocity of thought_.

Then, a student of von Helmholtz, **du Bois-Reymond** demonstrated the electrical basis of nerve impulse. Around the same period, they started identifying discrete brain regions, period motor and sensory regions...

## Birth of cognitive science

George A Miller presented the _magical number seven, plus or minus two_, a paper referring to the capacity we have at any time, a certain quantity of information. We have limited capacity to maintain information, and we have to deal with it (it's like a momentary storage).

It argues that the number of objects an average human can hold in working memory is 7 pm 2, and it is frequently defined as the _Miller Law_.

Neuropsychology relies on the
logic that one way to understand
the workings of a system is to
systematically remove (or
inactivate) parts of it and
observe how the removal of
each part affects the system’s
functioning.

Dogma of the ghost in the machine: _thinking that mind and brain are separate (ED I'm not sure I understood that correctly)_. Talking about mind as an entity that does things is a category mistake turning it into something it is not. Mental activities are processes, properties of people.

20th century brain mapping technology, such as functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography
(PET), allowed researchers to investigate experimental
strategies of cognitive psychology by observing brain function.

"Cognitive Neuroscience" first coined in 1976 by psychologists Michael Gazzaniga (1939- ) and George Armitage Miller (1920–2012).
