# Cognitive neuroscience
*lesson from 2021/02/22*

We started talking about this discipline around 1976 by psychologists (Gazzaniga/Miller). Gazzaniga was one of those people that really made a point about the relationship, studying **split brain patients** (patients in which the left and right brain are artificially separated, so there's no interaction between the two parts). This treatment actually stopped the spread of epilectic seizures, and apparently the person started to be quite normal, until they noticed that the person started to behave as **two different people**!

What do we mean by **cognitive neuroscience**? It's an integration of multiple disciplines, mixing psychology, neuroscience, cognition, social cognition, emotional processing, computer models, which studies the neural processes underlying cognition.

We have **neuroscience** on one hand (known and discussed for many years, _wet neuroscience_) and **cognitive science** on the other. Putting these two (science of the neuron vs science of cognition) led to this science, trying to understand the relation between the structure of the brain and its function.

We are basically studying the relation between the system (body) and its functions (the behaviour).

## A little (?) bit of history
So, _how did we get there?_ Or _how does the brain create the mind?_ This is known as the **mind-body problem**. Philosophers have always been interested in this question.

- Galenus (129-210 AC) The first to claim that the mind was localized in the brain was but personality and emotion are generated by other organs. He also thought that mind and physical properties were completely separated and that could be proven scientifically (which we are still trying to do).
- Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) did believe that the brain and the nervous system are the centre of the mind and emotion.
- Rene' Descartes (1596-1650, also known as Cartesio) believed in the sharp distinction between the physical and the mental. He recognized that the brain has a key role for sensory input and motor output, but this did not make it the basis of mind. He thought that physical experiences were sent to the _pineal gland_, located in the brain, that acted as a connection between mind and body. Importance of _pineal gland_ was actually wrong but thinking that conscious experience was located in the fusiform region of the brain is right. Descartes also made a distinction between what would now be called “bottom-up” (from the body) and “top-down” (from the soul) processes. Connection between "bottom-up" and "top-down" processes remain an open subject in cognitive neuroscience research. Furthermore passions, such as joy and anger, agitate and disturb the mind. There is, therefore, a clear distinction between the phisycal and the mental: the _res extensa_ (physical) and the _res cogita_ (inconsistent thinking materia).
- Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) proposed that mental and physical are just different aspects of the same substance tha creates chemical reactions in the human body.
- Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) proposed that the mind and the body are separated substances but constructed from the outset to run together in perfect harmony.
- Offray de la Mettrie (1709-1751) believed that matter (the phisical components) is fundamental and is the cause of mental events. Voluntary (cognitive) processes result simply from more complex mechanisms than involuntary and instinctive processes. This is in essence the believe held by many of us who are currently working in the field of cognitive neuroscience
- David Hartley (1705-1757) provided the basis for modern physiological psychology which studies which biological processes relates to psychological sensations. Hartley tought that this interaction was ruled by biological vibration which induced psychological fenomens. 
- Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) divided the brain into sections that corresponded to certain behaviors and traits that he called fundamental
  faculties. This is referred to as localization of function, building a mapping between psychological behaviours and brain areas. Gall developed the theory of Organology and the method of Cranioscopy that would later be known as Phrenology. Phrenology was later disproved by Pierre Flourens (1794-1867) by showing how brain damages in dogs and pidgeons had consequences on locomotor activities but not in sexual preferences. The idea that having a bigger portion of the brain could be related to being part of a complex process made sense but the way of doing this research was kinda questionable: he looked for _shapes_ in the head, like bumps, etc...
  Phrenology is nowadays seen as a _pseudo-science_, we can't really measure and locate morality and can be source of racist considerations, by relating ethnic characteristics to bad behaviours (e.g recognizing a criminal). His studies however helped establish psychology as a science!
- **John H Jackson**(1835-1911) produced the first scientific demonstration of localization of function. He started to try and localise the areas of the brain which control different functions, like muscles, by observing epilectic patients during seizures. Jackson proved scientifically a somantotopy and topographic organization of the brain: areas that controls fingers are close to areas that controls palms etc.
- Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) stated that the body-mind problem is actually unsolvable. Psychological behaviours are private and cannot be manipulated, therefore we can't model them scientifically. From Kant perspective psychology (study of the mind) is not a science while physiology (study of the brain) is. This resulted in a long period of time where neuroscience was thought to be impossible.
- **Gustav Fechner** (1801-1887) was a key figure in the development of psychophysics (what we still use today). He believed that mind and body were two aspects of a single entity and that mental processes could be measured. There exists a threshold under which mental stimulus don't produce any sensation and a small stimulus change results in a logaritmic sensation intensity. **Fechner succeeded in showing that the mental could be measured and was closely linked to the physical**.
- Willhelm Wundt (1832-1920), after the studies of Fechner, estabilished psychology as a scientific discipline.
- **Frans Donders** (1818-1889) proposed an important technique for measuring the duration of mental events as a function of reaction time to simulus. Simple reaction times are faster than choice reaction times, **the difference between them is the time required to make a choice**. This difference later became the standard for functional brain imaging and is used to isolate possibly correlated mental processes.

- **William James** (1842-1910) pointed out that mental processes can be abolished by brain injuries or altered by drugs, therefore Physiology is needed to understand Psychology. Introduced “psychophysics” as the study of the relation between physical stimuli and reportable sensations. James made the first tight relationship between consciousness and results from physiology results. [Cool article here](https://markmanson.net/the-prime-belief)
- Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1887) first started studying physiology when everyone thought that living process couldn't be reduced to physics and chemistry. He developed the myograph to measure the speed of nerve impulses, described as _velocity of thought_, which later lead to the Donders work. He also proposed the idea of _unconscious inferences_, falling into visual illusions and tricks, which would've been developed 100 years later.
- Emil du Bois-Reymond (1848) demonstrated the electrical basis of nerve impulse
- **Santiago Ramon y Cajal** (c.1890) **theorized the neuron, a discrete cell which is the primary computation unit of the nervous system.**
- **The first serious attempts to localize mental functions to specific locations in the brain was by Paul Broca** (1824-1880) **and Carl Wernicke** (1848-1905) by studying the effects of injuries to different parts of the brain on psychological functions. This studies gave birth to neuropsychologym which relies on the logic that by removing parts from the brain we can infer which part of the system they affect. Invasive operations still are one of the main foundations on studying brain activities.
- Jonh B Watson (1913) formalized **behaviourism**, psychology is purely objective and is the science that predicts and control the behaviour, which dominated brain studies until the 60s.
- Gilbert Ryle (1900-1976) proposed the _dogma of the ghost in a machine_: if we accept Descartes and Kant theories we end up trying to classify mind as an entity. This can't be done as we would turn mental activities, which are properties of people, into a category.
- **Goerge A Miller** presented in 1956 the _magical number seven, plus or minus two_, a paper referring to the capacity we have at any time. We have limited capacity to maintain information, and we have to deal with it (it's like a momentary storage).
- From the 60s on the development of brain mapping technology, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), allowed researchers to investigate experimental strategies of cognitive psychology by observing brain function.
- **Micheal Gazzaniga** (1939-) and **George Armitage Miller** (1920–2012), two psychologists, coined the term **Cognitive Neuroscience** 1976.
