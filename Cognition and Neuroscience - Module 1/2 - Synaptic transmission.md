# Synaptic transmission

What happens once the action potential goes from the dendrite, to the axion? The ionformation has to be transmitted from the pre synaptic to the post synaptic. We're talking about synaptic transmission, i.e. the commynication that takes place between neurons. 

So, what is a synapse? It's made of 3 main parts: pre-synaptic, the synaptic gap and the post synaptic. Interestingly enough, the parts are not phisically touching! There's a gap in which lots of things happen. 

We have already seen that in the terminal button we have the mytochondria, and the synaptic cleft contains fluids, through which the NT diffuse. 

It's important to get what the mechanism behind this is: the post-synaptic neuron will be in a situation that will either fire or not fire. There's lots of thinfs happening from the soma, where the vescicles are transmitted.

There's a mechanism through which we start having a change in the membrane that allows the vescicles to *dock* and release the neurotransmitters. This is due to calcium that binds with the proteins. 

What is really important is that we go from the pre synaptic to the post synaptic, providing excitatory information. We have 2 main types of post-synaptic receptors, the *ionotropic* (more directly influenced) and *metabotropic* (they go through several steps before, there's more room for *elaborated responses*).

Ionotropic receptors have a binding side, they have a membrane, the ion channels (either open or close, in order to be open a neurotransmitter has to be docked to it).

Metabotropic receptors go through a longer process, they allow for slower and longer lasting effects. 

Once we have seen this, we should look at what happens when we *record* informations! The impulse arrives in the presynaptic terminal, the NT release and bind to transmitter gated ion-channels, then sodium enters and the **voltage changes**, in a *voltage ripple*, firing.

From this simple rule, we end up with a neuron firing or not firing. We talked about *currency of the nueron sending information is electric potential*, we see thousands of synaptic inputs. Imagine what we have said happens very often, getting information that can either be excitatory or inibitory.

Post-synaptic integration can be the interaction of these two activities: inhibitory synapses and excitatory post synaptic neuron activity. The balance/difference between these two inputs results in the action potential! 

This thing happens at different levels: different signals from different dendrites (neurons) add up to a much stronger post-synaptic potential!

Summarizing, we have an action potential, reaching the terminal button, releasing NT, which diffuses and bonds to receptor sites (causing ion gates to open), and excites post-synaptic neurons depending on the precise combination of inputs (excitatory/inhibitory NT and their spatial/temporal summation). The combinations are therefore endless! 

We don't have just yes/no situations, rather modulations in the potential. In the dendrites, if we have a very strong signal that is then stopped by an inhibitory signal, what could be a potentially triggering potential can be stopped! Of course, it's quite possible that one single terminal button won't be able to influence a strong potential. 

What is very important to understand is that once we have understood the single steps, these integrate continuously and seamlessly in our brain. What we call *resting state* doesn't really exist: there's change in the potential, but it's an oscillation around -17 mV. The timing is therefore important!

We have talked about excitatory potential, but we need potential to *stop actions too*. Hyperpolarization contributes to the fluctuation of membrane potential

Rather than recording from a single neuron, what is recorded (despite the fact that there are thousands of channels), the local field potential is often observed to  fluctuate ina  orderly obscillation. I we had tens of hundreds of neurons sending information (excitatory or inhibitory) we would imagine a kind of *structure* in this information: the potential is not constant, neither random. There are some **patterns** between the neurons sending/receiving informations!

These patterns can be measured, and they are **obscillations**! Despite being currently debated, they are often associated with functions. We can actually see this obscillations, and this activity is actually well structured! We'd want to associate a certain pattern to a given behaviour.

Actually, the brain is organizing the firing in a way that **can be decoded**!

In may current models of neural function, **synchrony plays a critical role**. When we talk bout wynchronization between different areas of the brain, we're talking about **phase synchronization**.

Electroencephalography allows us to study the electrical potential in our brain, to try and understand the relation between a certain behaviour and the signals in our brain.

We can record intracellularly and extracellularly. The latter looks similar, though the *single spikes* become obscillations. Understading what the EEg is recording ain't straightforward: we don't see a clear measure of the action potential, rather something that *might pick up some signal in the brain*. The EEG is not measuring the action potential per se, rather the summation of post synaptic potential: not what happens in the pre synaptic, just what does in the post. What we see are the results on these pre synaptic neurons that influence the post synaptic potentials. The EEG combines the activity of lots of similarly oriented pyramidal neurons, and requires synchronous groups of activity across groups of cells. The EEG reflects summed post synaptic activity of large cell ensembles. It provides us a bit of an understating of what happens under the hood.

By measuring brain activity we can start to understand what's going on in our brain and what part of the brain is producing it. This is kind of an *inverse problem*: how do we go back from the recorded signal to what is inside the brain, i.e. which area of the brain produced this activity.

There's plenty of algorithms that try to reconstruct this by basing on some assumptions. Some of these mathematical models are quite strong, trying to use biologically inspired constraints. For example, epilectic patients show that seizures are happening just in one part of the brain! In some cases these is relevant and works pretty well.

So, how does the brain organize its activity when information happens? If we measure this only once, you have nothing in general. What you'll have is actually a lot of ongoing activity in the brain. If you average this alltogether, you get a flat line. But if you present a signal and average it, the activity becomes oscillatory. In real life, we get the signal AND the noise, so if we get one single signal we won't see anything. But if we take repeated measures over and over, the average noise effect will be diminished and you'll get to the real signal. 

# Noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation

We don't have to open up the skull! But we are still able to stimulate the brain from outside. There are obviously safety issues.

// I lost myself to an API, approx. 20 minutes are missing lol sorry

A widely used shape is the 8-coil. Why is this? Magnets are produced as circular coils, while this is a two-circular coil. What happens is that actually the two wings get stronger at the intersection, and this maximizes the magnetic field that is delivered to the brain. We are therefore maximizing the amount of magnetic field that is produced at this point.
