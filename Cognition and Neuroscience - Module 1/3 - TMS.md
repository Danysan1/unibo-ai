# TMS

TMS is a fundamental tool for various applications, like neurological assessment by measuring the response of muscles to the stimulation of the cortex,the delay, the amplitude, to assess the integrity of the corticospinal tract, for example. 

It could also be used as treatment for migrains, schizophrenia, tinnitus...

There are some safety issues involved, like it could provide discomfort/pain, and it requires stringent control conditions. 

# tES

tES is much safer. It's cheaper, more portable (TMS is super heavy and needs more people to carry it around), much easier to sham (whatever it means). In terms of applications, given these premises, we may use them for the same things (cognitive NS, translational research, depression, migraine...). Finally, it requires a less trained operator.

# Sensation and perception of visual signals

We'll want to understand how we can go from detection to action, i.e. we adapt to the environment. 

This important from our perspective: we can find a parallelism between what happens in the brain and what we'll want to happen in the computer., and understand how the brain is made to *artificially recreate that*.

Sensation is the term given to the neural processes that correspond to **detection**, i.e. the process in which we try to feel modifications in the *outside world*.

We're therefore translating information from the environment into a neural signal. 

We have to talk about attention, i.e. how we prioritize informations in the environment, for example a *boom* would draw our attention. We have to talk about perception, i.e. the identification of features through senses. Finally, we have to talk about *action*, referring to acts of a system that needs to be integrated into the environment by interacting with it, adapting to it, adapting it to its needs.

These are a set of tools that we can implement.

Sensation translates information into signals: the nervous ystem represents an object through a neural code, a format differernt from the physical properties of the object itself. The brain senses information in a format which is different from the original. This is somewhat similar to natural language: it encodes things through action potentials and neurotransmitters. We still don;t know lots about this code.

The FOVEA corresponds to the part of the retina in which our acuity is sharpest. In **phototransduction**, light is converted into neural signals thanks to *photoreceptors*, which lead to action potentials from the change in membrane potential. We have a blind spot: the point in which the optic nerve comes out of the eye, but we don't realize this because our brain makes things up.
